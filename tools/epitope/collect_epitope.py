Collect epitope results into the table.

Reads the per-design <name>.tsv files that epitope_worker.py wrote under
<run_dir>/<table>/epitope[_<label>]/ and merges them back as <prefix>_status /
<prefix>_path (the per-target-residue TSV: chain, resnum, resname, n_contacts,
min_dist, is_hotspot -- EVERY target residue, contacted or not) plus one
<prefix>_<field> column per metric:

  DID IT LAND ON THE EPITOPE I CHOSE:
    hotspot_recall        contacted hotspots / listed hotspots, 0.0-1.0. This is
                          the filter column. 0.0 is a REAL value (the binder bound
                          somewhere else); NA means nothing was measured.
    hotspot_hits          the hotspots contacted, comma-joined, or 'none'
    n_hotspots            how many were listed -- the denominator
    min_dist_hotspot      closest heavy-atom approach to ANY listed hotspot, A.
                          The graded signal when recall is 0: 6 A is a near miss,
                          40 A is the other side of the target.

  THE TRUST COLUMN -- read it before believing any of the above:
    hotspot_resnames      the residue NAME found at each listed hotspot position,
                          in the order listed: 'A96=LYS,A99=GLU,...'. If those are
                          not the residues you chose, the structure was renumbered
                          and every other column here answers a different question.
                          (A hotspot number that is ABSENT from the target is an
                          error status, not a recall of 0 -- this column is for the
                          nastier case where the number exists but means something
                          else.)

  WHICH EPITOPE IT ACTUALLY USED:
    n_iface_target_res    target residues with >= 1 contact
    iface_target_resnums  which ones, comma-joined ('A94,A96,A97,...'), or 'none'.
                          Compare two designs' lists to see whether a confident
                          binder found a different site.
    n_contacts            total heavy-atom contact pairs across the interface. A
                          crude size proxy only -- for interface AREA use cms
                          (sc, sc_area) or pyrosetta (if_dSASA).

  HOW CENTRAL THE LISTED HOTSPOTS ARE TO THAT INTERFACE -- the same matrix again,
  restricted to the listed residues (added 2026-10-02). hotspot_recall says
  'touched'; these say 'how much of the binding is there':
    hotspot_n_contacts    contact pairs on the LISTED hotspots only. Same cutoff,
                          same pair counting as n_contacts, fewer residues, so
                          hotspot_n_contacts <= n_contacts always.
    hotspot_contact_frac  hotspot_n_contacts / n_contacts, 0.0-1.0: the SHARE of
                          this design's interface carried by the listed residues.
                          THE FILTER COLUMN when the question is 'grazed it' vs
                          'built around it'. Read it as a share, not an area: an
                          interface of 300 pairs and one of 80 pairs can both sit
                          at 0.15. NA when n_contacts is 0 (the share is 0/0,
                          undefined) -- while hotspot_n_contacts is a real 0 there.
                          It counts ATOM pairs, so a big, deeply inserted side
                          chain scores higher than a small one at equal burial.
    hotspot_contacts      the per-hotspot pair counts in the order --hotspots was
                          given, 'A24=0,A36=3,A99=21'. Formatted like
                          hotspot_resnames and in the same order, so the two read
                          against each other. An explicit 0 is a measured zero.

  WHICH OF THE BINDER'S OWN RESIDUES DO THE BINDING -- the same matrix, read along
  its other axis (added 2026-09-30):
    n_iface_design_res    design residues with >= 1 contact
    iface_design_resnums  which ones, comma-joined ('B12,B15,B19,...') in ASCENDING
                          residue order, or 'none'
    iface_design_resnames THE BINDER-SIDE TRUST COLUMN: the same residues with the
                          identity at each one, 'B12=HIS,B15=TYR,B19=GLU,...',
                          formatted exactly like hotspot_resnames and in the same
                          order as iface_design_resnums. Eyeball it: a frame shift
                          between a designed sequence and its backbone is obvious
                          here and invisible everywhere else.

  WHERE THE DESIGN IDENTITIES CAME FROM -- read before believing the names above:
    seq_source            'structure' (identities from the coordinates -- the
                          default and the original behaviour) or the sequence
                          column they were taken from
    seq_len               length of the sequence actually used
    n_design_res_struct   amino-acid residues in the design chain(s) of the
                          STRUCTURE. A disagreement with seq_len is an 'error:',
                          never a truncated or padded mapping.

  THE ECHO OF WHAT WAS ASKED:
    design_chains         the binder chain(s) actually scored
    target_chains         the target chain(s) actually scored
    contact_cutoff        the A cutoff used -- a recall is only comparable with
                          another recall at the same cutoff

NA (empty) rather than 0 marks a metric that could not be measured: the design
failed, a chain was absent, a hotspot did not exist, or no TSV was written. A
hotspot_recall of 0.0 with status OK is the opposite -- a successful measurement of
a binder that ignored the epitope -- and the two must never be confused, which is
why nothing here defaults to zero.

Statuses: 'OK'; 'error: ...' for an absent design or target chain, a hotspot absent
from the target chain (the numbering contract), an unreadable structure, a structure
path that could not be resolved from the input column (on the row or up the
lineage), a --sequence-column whose length disagrees with the structure or which
holds a multi-chain '/' string, or a crashed worker; 'missing' when the design has
no TSV at all.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY. The columns added on 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-02 are
appended, never substituted: every pre-existing column keeps its name, type,
formatting and meaning, and with --sequence-column omitted every pre-existing
number is bit-for-bit what it was. Rows collected before those dates simply have
the newer columns empty -- a missing column in the per-design TSV reads back as
NA, like any other unmeasured metric.
