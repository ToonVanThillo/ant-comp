"""
Which target residues does this binder actually touch, and did it hit the epitope?

This is the per-array-task step of the epitope tool (and works standalone). One task
scores several designs. For each design it counts heavy-atom contacts between
``--design-chains`` (the binder) and every residue of ``--target-chains`` (the
target), then reports the epitope that was ACTUALLY used and how much of the
REQUESTED one it covers.

It measures CONTACT and nothing else -- no buried surface area (that is cms), no
energy (that is pyrosetta), no assembly fit (that is ringfit), and no judgement at
all about whether the coordinates it was handed are trustworthy.

DEFINITIONS, all at ``--contact-cutoff`` A between heavy atoms (hydrogens and
waters excluded; a ligand sitting in a named chain counts as part of that chain):

    contact pair        one design heavy atom within the cutoff of one target
                        heavy atom. n_contacts is the total over the interface.
    interface residue   a target residue with >= 1 contact pair. The list of them
                        IS the epitope the binder used.
    hotspot hit         a hotspot that is an interface residue.
    hotspot_recall      hits / listed hotspots.
    hotspot_n_contacts  contact pairs on the LISTED hotspots only -- the same
                        pairs, the same cutoff, just summed over fewer residues.
    hotspot_contact_frac
                        hotspot_n_contacts / n_contacts: the SHARE of the whole
                        interface the listed residues carry, 0.0-1.0. Undefined
                        (NA) when n_contacts is 0 -- never 0.0.
    hotspot_contacts    the per-hotspot pair counts in the order listed,
                        'A24=0,A36=3,A99=21'.

WEIGHT IS NOT PRESENCE. hotspot_recall answers 'did it touch the epitope'; the
three columns above answer 'how much of the binding is on it'. On a target where
nearly every binder grazes one residue, recall discriminates nothing and the share
does. Read the share as a SHARE: it is a fraction of this design's own interface,
so a 300-pair interface and an 80-pair one can carry the same 0.15, and a rising
share can mean the hotspot got more buried OR that the rest of the interface got
smaller. It is also a count of ATOM PAIRS, so a large, deeply inserted side chain
(ARG, TRP, a histidine wedged into a pocket) contributes more pairs than a small
one at the same burial -- the number is weighted by atom count, not by energy.

BOTH AXES OF THE SAME MATRIX. The contact matrix has a target side and a design
side, and both are reported. The target side answers "which epitope did it use"
(n_iface_target_res, iface_target_resnums, the hotspot_* columns); the design side
answers "which of MY residues are doing the binding" (n_iface_design_res,
iface_design_resnums, iface_design_resnames). Same cutoff, same matrix, one pass.
``iface_design_resnames`` is to the binder what ``hotspot_resnames`` is to the
target: 'B12=HIS,B15=TYR,B19=GLU', eyeballable, and a frame shift is obvious in it.

WHERE THE DESIGN-CHAIN IDENTITIES COME FROM. By default, from the coordinates.
With ``--seq-source <column name>`` the task file carries a one-chain sequence per
design and the identities are taken from THAT, mapped positionally onto the design
chains' amino-acid residues in structure order. The contact GEOMETRY always comes
from the structure. The reason: a sequence designer writes its sequence into a
CHILD table while the backbone that defines the geometry lives in the PARENT, and
that backbone's own residue names are generator artifacts, not the designed
sequence. Two hard contracts, because a positional mapping that is off by one
misreports the interface composition of every row with no other symptom:

    len(sequence) != <design-chain amino-acid residues>
                        -> 'error: ...' naming BOTH numbers. Never truncate,
                           never pad, never score a partial mapping.
    a '/' in the sequence
                        -> 'error: ...'. This tool wants the design chain alone;
                           a multi-chain string means the wrong column was named.

``seq_len``, ``n_design_res_struct`` and ``seq_source`` record what was actually
used, so the table always says where the residue names came from.

THE NUMBERING CONTRACT. A hotspot label that is not a residue of the target chains
is an ERROR for that design (status 'error: ...', every column NA), never a recall
of 0.0. The error message reports the residue-number span actually present in each
target chain, because the cause is nearly always a renumbered chain. On success,
``hotspot_resnames`` records the residue NAME found at each listed position, in the
order listed -- the cheap way to see that A96 really is the lysine you meant.

NA IS NEVER 0. A design that failed has NA columns. A binder that touched the
target but missed every hotspot has ``hotspot_recall 0.0`` and ``hotspot_hits
'none'``; a binder that touched nothing at all has ``n_iface_target_res 0`` and
``iface_target_resnums 'none'``. The string 'none' is deliberate: an empty cell
would be read back as NA, and "measured, and the answer is nothing" must stay
distinguishable from "not measured".

Writes, per design, ``<name>.tsv`` (one row: name, status, path, metrics...) and,
on success, ``<name>_per_residue.tsv`` -- EVERY target residue, contacted or not,
with chain, resnum, resname, n_contacts, min_dist and is_hotspot. The full target is
written on purpose: it is the per-design record in which a numbering mismatch or a
second, unintended binding site is visible at a glance.

Errors are recorded as data (status 'error: ...') so a partial array still collects.

Normally invoked per array task by the epitope tool -- run ``sapia run epitope``
rather than calling this directly.
