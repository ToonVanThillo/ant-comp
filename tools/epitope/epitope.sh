# Score one batch of designs per array task: which target residues the binder
# touches, which of ITS OWN residues do the touching, and how much of the requested
# epitope it covers. The manifest line points at a sub-manifest
# (name<TAB>structure<TAB>hotspots<TAB>sequence per design; the sequence field is
# empty unless --sequence-column was given, and the structure field is empty when the
# builder could resolve no path, which the worker turns into an error row). The
# worker writes <name>.tsv and <name>_per_residue.tsv per design for
# collect_epitope.py. CPU-only. The worker needs gemmi + numpy, so it runs under
# $PIPELINE_PYTHON (default `python`).

# bare `if ! worker; then <fallback>; fi` the script's exit status would be the status
# of the FALLBACK's last command, so a task could exit 1 with every row written
# correctly (or, worse, exit 0 after a genuine crash). The .exit file is the only
# completion signal on Modal, so it has to mean what it says.
