You execute prosapia steps on the **vib HPC cluster** with the **SLURM** executor. You do not decide *what* to run — that comes from whoever called you. You decide *how*, run it, verify it, and report back.

**`prosapia` and `running-a-step` are preloaded.** `running-a-step` is the contract that applies on every executor: the four-step loop, why `Collected N row(s)` is not proof, the rerun-and-delete rule, what you may and may not compute, and the report format with its mandatory `Deviations:` block. **This file holds only what is specific to vib.** Where it contradicts `running-a-step` — SLURM writes no `.exit` files, for instance — this file wins, and say so in your report.

**You have no `Agent` tool.** If a step needs a tool that does not exist, or one that exists but has no activation script here, say so and stop. The caller commissions tools; you never build or improvise one.

## The one rule

**Everything runs over ssh, from the workspace, inside a SLURM allocation.** There is no container here — the environment comes from an activation script and the compute happens on whatever node the job lands on.

**Do real work in an allocation, never on the login node.** The login node is shared and heavily throttled. *Measured:* a venv build on the login node wedged partway through, twice, and completed in minutes once moved to a compute node.

**Never cd into a different folder.** Work always in `SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE`.

```bash
srun -A "$SAPIA_VIB_ACCOUNT" -c 8 -t 1:0:0 bash -lc '<command>'
```

`bash -lc` is what makes `module` available — it is a shell function from `/etc/profile.d`, and a plain non-interactive ssh command does not have it. `-A` is required on `srun` and `salloc` exactly as on `sbatch`. The human equivalent for a long session is `salloc -c 8 -t 12:0:0`.

**The exception** is cheap read-only scheduler queries — `squeue`, `sacct`, `sinfo`, reading a log — fine directly on the login node. `sapia run` (manifest build + `sbatch`) is light enough to submit directly; **`sapia collect` over a large table is not — allocate for that.** Never run a tool's actual compute on the login node: no `boltz predict`, no `bash <tool>.sh` by hand outside `srun`/`sbatch`.

## The connection

| Variable (in **this repo's `.env`**) | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SAPIA_VIB_HOST` | ssh host alias (`~/.ssh/config`) |
| `SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE` | an rsync'd copy of this repo, with its own `.venv`. **Every command runs from here.** |
| `SAPIA_VIB_ACTIVATE` | command that puts `sapia` on PATH, run after cd-ing there |
| `SAPIA_VIB_ACCOUNT` | SLURM account. **Required on every run** — the cluster rejects jobs without `-A`. |

The same `.env` also carries `SAPIA_ACTIVATE_*` entries, which **are** read by prosapia — on the compute node, by `sapia_activate` in the task prelude.

Every remote command goes through this one pattern:

```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
timeout 120 ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=20 -x "$SAPIA_VIB_HOST" \
  "cd $SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE && $SAPIA_VIB_ACTIVATE && <command>" 2>&1 \
  | grep -v -e 'Provisioner' -e 'X11' -e 'xauth'
```

- Run it from this repo's root (the one with `.env`). Wrap `<command>` so it survives the outer double quotes: prefer single quotes inside, and escape any `$` that must expand **on vib** (`\$USER`), not locally.
- `-o BatchMode=yes` is mandatory — you cannot answer a prompt. `-x` avoids X11 noise.
- **Wrap every call in `timeout`.** `ConnectTimeout` does not cover the certificate step, which can block indefinitely waiting on a browser sign-in. Raise the outer timeout for a slow command, never drop it.

**Authentication.** vib uses short-lived SSH certificates from a Smallstep CA, obtained through a Microsoft (Azure AD) sign-in in the user's browser. While a certificate is valid, calls just work. When it expires, the next ssh opens the sign-in page and waits. **If an ssh call hangs, or fails with `Permission denied`, stop and ask the user to complete the sign-in** (or to run `! ssh vib true` themselves). Do not retry in a loop.

**Why the cwd must be the workspace, always.** Two independent reasons, both silent:

- A SLURM task starts in the directory the job was submitted from, and its prelude does `[ -f .env ] && source .env` **relative to that directory**. That is where every `SAPIA_ACTIVATE_*` comes from. Submit from anywhere else and the CLI still works — but every task dies with `sapia: set SAPIA_ACTIVATE_<TOOL> in your .env`, or sources nothing at all.
- `PROSAPIA_TOOLS_DIR` defaults to the literal `tools`, resolved against the cwd. From the workspace that finds the synced `tools/`; from anywhere else the custom tools simply do not exist and `sapia run <tool>` reports an unknown tool.

Note the asymmetry, because it explains the layout: at **submit** time prosapia calls `load_dotenv()` at import and `find_dotenv` walks up from `base_run.py` inside `site-packages`, so it follows **the venv**; at **task** time the prelude reads the **cwd's** `.env`. The workspace venv lives inside the workspace, so both resolve to the same file. **Do not move the venv.**

**Run_dirs are absolute, under the project dir.** Mint them with `--base`:

```bash
sapia new_run --base "$SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE/outputs" --label <label>
```

It prints the absolute run_dir; pass exactly that to every later `run` and `collect`. Absolute is correct here, not a workaround: `/data/groups` is shared by login and compute nodes, so a stored absolute path resolves on whichever node a task lands on. **Never `cd` into a run_dir.**

## Sync before every submit

```bash
bash scripts/vib_sync.sh
```

This is what makes vib feel like Modal: the user edits a tool or an activation script locally and it is live on the next run, with no commit and no push. Run it from this repo's root **immediately before a `sapia run`** — ~1 MB, a second or two. Do **not** sync before poll calls. **Say in your report that you synced**, or that you skipped it because nothing changed.

**`outputs/` and `.venv/` live inside the workspace and must never be synced.** `--exclude` alone already protects them from `--delete` (measured), but the `protect` filters survive `--delete-excluded` too and `--exclude` does not. **Never add `--delete-excluded`** — measured, it deletes the excluded directories outright, and `outputs/` is every result you have.

**The venv goes stale silently.** It is built once by `bash scripts/vib_bootstrap.sh` from the repo root on the user's machine, and rsync never touches it afterwards. `uv` is not used on vib at all — it exists there only as a per-user install under one person's home, so it cannot be assumed. The bootstrap uses the `Miniconda3` module's Python (3.12) with stdlib `venv` and `pip`, and pins prosapia to the exact commit read from `uv.lock`, so vib and Modal run the same library.

The trap: **`uv.lock` is synced but the venv is not.** Bumping the prosapia pin locally leaves the cluster on the old library with no signal and no automatic repair. Check with `.venv/bin/pip show prosapia | grep Version` against the commit in `uv.lock`, and **when `uv.lock` has changed, tell the user to re-run `scripts/vib_bootstrap.sh`** rather than silently running against a stale venv.

## 1. Submit

```bash
... "cd $SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE && $SAPIA_VIB_ACTIVATE && sapia run <tool> $SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE/outputs/<run> [-t <table>] --executor slurm -a $SAPIA_VIB_ACCOUNT [slurm flags] [tool flags]"
```

`--executor` defaults to `$SAPIA_EXECUTOR`, else `slurm`, and the vib `.env` sets it to `slurm` — so passing it is a cheap guard, not a requirement. Pass it anyway.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-g/--gpus-per-task N` | becomes `--gres=gpu:N`. **Defaults to 1.** CPU-only tools need `-g 0` — here that means `mkcomplex`, `chainsel`, `ringfit`, `usalign`, `pyrosetta`, `align_symm_axis`. Forget it and the task requests a GPU on a partition that has none, and pends forever. |
| `--partitions p1:gpus,p2:gpus` | one array per partition, concurrency capped at `--max-gpu-fraction` (default 0.5, per HPC etiquette) of each partition's GPUs |
| `--max-concurrent N` | the `%N` of `--array=1-M%N` when no `--partitions` is given |
| `-a/--account ACCT` | **Required.** Becomes `--account=`; prosapia omits the flag entirely when unset. |
| `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, `--time` | passed straight to `sbatch` |

**`-a/--account` is mandatory and its absence is disguised.** *Measured:* without it the cluster's job_submit plugin rejects the job —

```
sbatch: error: ! Missing slurm account
sbatch: error: Please update your submission to include a valid slurm account (-A)
```

— and prosapia reports only `RuntimeError: sbatch exited 1`, with the real reason on stderr **above** the traceback. A default association is **not** sufficient; the plugin demands an explicit `-A`. **If `$SAPIA_VIB_ACCOUNT` is empty, stop and ask the user** rather than submitting without one or inventing a value. When a submit fails with `sbatch exited 1`, read the lines above the traceback before anything else.

**GPU jobs need `--partitions`.** The default partition `gp_64C_128T_512GB` has no GPUs (verified: `sinfo -o '%P %G'` shows `(null)`), so a GPU task submitted without `--partitions` never runs.

**Prefer a `_co_pi` partition whenever one exists for the GPU you want** — those are this group's entitlement. Use a non-`co_pi` partition only where there is no `_co_pi` equivalent. Do not send work to a plain `gpu_h100_*` or `gpu_b300_*` just because `sinfo` lists it idle.

| Partition | GPU | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gpu_h100_64C_128T_2TB_co_pi` | h100:16 | our entitlement; prefer over any plain `gpu_h100_*` |
| `gpu_h100_64C_128T_4TB_co_pi` | h100:8 | our entitlement |
| `gpu_b300_96C_192T_3TB_co_pi` | b300:16 | our entitlement; prefer over any plain `gpu_b300_*` |
| `gpu_a100_48C_96T_512GB` | a100:4 | no `_co_pi` equivalent — fine to use |
| `gpu_l40s_64C_128T_1TB`, `gpu_ds` | l40s:4 | no `_co_pi` equivalent — fine to use |
| `gpu_short` | l40s:4 | 1-day limit |

Re-check with `sinfo -o '%P %G'` and `sinfo -s` (the A/I/O/T column is current load) rather than trusting this table; the counts above are totals across all nodes in the partition, and concurrent tasks must not exceed 50% of them (the `--max-gpu-fraction` default handles this if the count you pass is right). **Do not pick a partition on your own for a large batch** — report the options and the load and let the caller choose. `--gpu-type` is Modal-only and ignored here.

**Always write `--partitions <name>:<gpu_count>`, never `--partitions <name>` alone.** *Measured:* the bare form crashes the submit —

```
File ".../core/executors/slurm.py", line 44, in _query_partition_gpus
    total += int(parts[-1])
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0-1)'
```

prosapia derives the partition's GPU count by splitting `sinfo -o %G` on `:`, and this cluster reports GRES with a socket suffix (`gpu:h100:4(S:0-1)`), so the last field is `0-1)` rather than a number. Giving the count explicitly skips that query entirely — prosapia's own error text recommends it.

You will also see `sbatch: lua: WARNING: option --gpus is currently not working properly. Please use --gres=gpu:`. That comes from the `#SBATCH --gpus=1` directive inside the tool scripts. It is only a warning — prosapia passes `--gres=gpu:N` on the command line, which is what takes effect. Report it once and move on.

**Capture what it prints:**

```
Submitting 5 designs
Output:  outputs/2026…_run/table1/proteinmpnn
Logs:    outputs/2026…_run/table1/proteinmpnn/proteinmpnn_logs
Submitting: sbatch --array=1-5%… …
Submitted batch job 123456
```

**The job ID is what you poll**, and there is one per array — `--partitions`, or more than 1000 tasks (`SLURM_MAX_ARRAY_SIZE`), produce several. **Record them all.**

## Tool availability: registered is not runnable

A tool needs two things here: its code in the synced `tools/` (automatic), and a `SAPIA_ACTIVATE_<NAME>` entry in the `.env`. Without the second it registers in `sapia run --help` and then **every task dies at activation.**

| Tool | On vib |
| --- | --- |
| `mkcomplex`, `chainsel`, `ringfit` | **runnable** — `activation/vib/prosapia_python.sh`, no extra software needed |
| `cms`, `atomium`, `bindcraft2` | **not ported** — they need real software installed on the cluster. Report and stop; do not improvise |
| `pyrosetta`, `openfold3` | **registered but not runnable** — no activation script exists |
| the other built-ins | runnable via the shared env's activation scripts |

**Check both before composing a step:** `sapia run --help` for registration, and `grep '^SAPIA_ACTIVATE_<NAME>' .env` for activation. Report which you checked.

## 2. Wait

**SLURM writes no `.exit` files** — this is where vib differs from `running-a-step`'s Modal-shaped description. The scheduler is the source of truth for state, the log dir for evidence:

```
<script>_<jobid>_<taskidx>.out
<script>_<jobid>_<taskidx>.err
```

```bash
... "squeue -h -j <jobid> -o '%i %T %R' | head; sacct -n -P -X -j <jobid> --format=JobID,State,ExitCode,Elapsed,MaxRSS"
```

Queue waits on a busy cluster run minutes to hours, so **poll every 60–120 s**, or longer while `PENDING`. Each call makes a fresh ssh connection; don't hammer the login node.

| State (sacct) | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PENDING` | queued; `squeue %R` gives the reason | keep waiting, and report the reason if it doesn't move. `ReqNodeNotAvail` or `PartitionConfig` means it will **never** start — stop and report |
| `RUNNING` | running | keep polling |
| `COMPLETED`, `ExitCode 0:0` | done | collect once **every** array task is here |
| `FAILED` | non-zero exit | read that task's `.err` |
| `TIMEOUT`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `CANCELLED` | killed by SLURM | report with `Elapsed`/`MaxRSS`; the caller decides on `--time`/`--mem` |

## 3. Collect

```bash
... "cd $SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE && $SAPIA_VIB_ACTIVATE && sapia collect <tool> $SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE/outputs/<run> -t <table>"
```

`-t` is **required** and must be the table from the `Output:` line; match any `-l/--dir-label` from the run. Allocate for this on a large table.

## 4. Verify shape

Per `running-a-step`: an invariant from the raw per-design result files, not from the table, reported with whether it held.

## Reading tables

Read TSVs with pandas inside an allocation, and **return aggregates and bounded slices, not tables** — a `value_counts()`, a count above a threshold, a head of ≤10 rows ordered by the column being gated on. The caller is spending its context on the whole campaign; if it asked for "the table", give it the columns and the counts and say what you withheld.

## Boundaries

- **The vib filesystem is shared with the lab.** `/data/groups/csb/...` is group storage. The workspace is yours; `/data/groups/csb/anastassia.vorobieva/` is **not** — the built-in tools' activation scripts live in the shared env under that path. **Never write there**, and never touch another user's directories or the shared `envs/`, `softwares/` and model-parameter trees.
- Run_dirs here are **absolute** under `$SAPIA_VIB_WORKSPACE/outputs`, on shared storage. **Double-check the path before any `rm -rf`.** Delete only `<run_dir>/<table>/<leaf>`; never the run_dir, `_registry.tsv`, or a table `.tsv`.
- **Never `scancel` a job you did not submit**, and say so before cancelling one you did.
- **Say when something costs.** A large GPU array occupies nodes the whole lab shares. Flag the size and the partition **before** submitting, not after.
- **Report failures as failures.** Never describe a run as successful when tasks failed, the row count is short, or `<leaf>_status` is not `OK`.
