"""
Collect BindCraft2 campaign results into the (child) binder table.

``run_bindcraft2.py`` points each campaign's ``project_folder`` at
``<out_dir>/campaigns/<name>/``, where BindCraft2 writes three stage folders, each
with a table this collector can read:

    campaigns/<name>/1_Trajectories/!_Trajectories.csv        one row per attempt
    campaigns/<name>/1_Trajectories/<design>/<design>_trajectory[_<target>].cif
    campaigns/<name>/2_Refolded/!_Refolded.csv       every scored candidate + outcome
    campaigns/<name>/2_Refolded/Complexes/<design>[_<target>].cif
    campaigns/<name>/3_Ranked/!_Ranked.csv          the accepted designs, best-first
    campaigns/<name>/3_Ranked/<design>[_<target>].cif

Which one to read is **decided by the run, not guessed here**: a `--trajectory-only`
run fills `1_Trajectories` and never accepts anything, so `3_Ranked` stays empty. The
run records that in the out_dir sidecar and `--stage auto` (the default) follows it,
the same contract that keeps `input_column` consistent between the two phases. Pass
`--stage` explicitly only to override.

* ``trajectories`` -- the hallucinated **backbones**, before any sequence redesign.
  The rows to hand to `atomium` / `proteinmpnn`. Note their `sequence` is the one the
  gradient happened to land on, which is exactly what you are about to replace.
* ``refolded`` -- every candidate the campaign scored, rejects included, with
  ``outcome`` and ``failed_filters``. What to read when a campaign accepted nothing.
* ``ranked`` -- only what the campaign accepted.

A trajectory row's ``terminated`` column names the stage the attempt stopped at;
blank means it ran to completion. They are collected rather than dropped, so filter
on it (``-f``) instead of assuming every row is a usable backbone.

MULTI-TARGET
------------
A campaign with TWO OR MORE targets does not write one column per target. BindCraft2
packs each metric into a single cell, semicolon-separated, in the order given by the
row's own ``targets`` column -- which is sorted by weight, so off-targets (negative
weight) come last (``campaign_output.target_ordered_row``; a campaign with fewer than
two targets is left completely untouched, so single-target tables are unaffected).

A packed cell is not a number: ``-f`` cannot threshold it and a sort would order it
as text. So this collector keeps the packed cell verbatim **and** splits it:

    bindcraft2_targets          hPDL1;mPDL1;hPD1
    bindcraft2_target_weights   1;1;-0.5
    bindcraft2_i_pTM            0.82;0.79;0.21     <- verbatim, as BC2 wrote it
    bindcraft2_i_pTM__hPDL1     0.82               <- filterable
    bindcraft2_i_pTM__mPDL1     0.79
    bindcraft2_i_pTM__hPD1      0.21
    bindcraft2_i_pTM__worst     0.79               <- binding targets only
    bindcraft2_i_pTM__selectivity  0.58            <- weakest binder vs best off-target

The summary columns cover the **binding** targets only, mirroring
``campaign_output.on_target_mean``: averaging an off-target in would reward binding
the thing you are trying to avoid. They are emitted only for metrics whose direction
is known (METRIC_DIRECTION below); a metric outside that map still gets its
per-target split, just no summary.

Structures are per-target too (``<design>_<target>.cif``). ``<leaf>_path`` is the
highest-weight binding target's complex -- the one a downstream predictor should
look at -- and every other target's complex is kept beside it as
``<leaf>_path__<target>``. The earlier version of this collector globbed and took
the first match, which silently picked one arbitrary target and dropped the rest.

Rows are keyed by BindCraft2's own ``design`` identity rather than by position:
``!_Ranked.csv`` is re-sorted by ``i_pDAE`` after every acceptance, so an index into
it is not stable across a re-collect, while the design name (campaign, modality,
length and recipe hash) is. The submitter sets ``campaign_name`` to the parent row's
name, so a design name already starts with its parent; the prefix is only added here
when a --set override has changed that.

Each complex is converted to PDB (downstream tools consume PDB) and becomes the row's
``<leaf>_path``; the source mmCIF stays available as ``<leaf>_cif_path``. Note the
structure is the **complex**, binder + target, not the binder alone -- unless the
campaign ran with ``--save-monomers``, in which case the free binder is recorded
separately as ``<leaf>_monomer_path``.

If ``archive_trajectories`` zipped the per-design folders, the structures are read
straight out of the zip (stdlib ``zipfile``; the archive is a plain deflate zip whose
members are relative to ``1_Trajectories``) into ``<out_dir>/.unarchived/``. Nothing
in the campaign folder is modified.

Safe to re-run: rows are rebuilt from the CSV and the structures on disk.
