Submit an array (SLURM or Modal) asking, per design: DID THIS BINDER LAND ON THE
EPITOPE I CHOSE, AND WHICH TARGET RESIDUES DOES IT ACTUALLY TOUCH?

The decision it exists for: a de-novo binder campaign against a chosen epitope of a
target produces designs that are confident, well folded, and bound somewhere else.
"Somewhere else" is invisible in every confidence score and in every interface-size
metric -- a binder sitting on the opposite face of the target has a perfectly good
if_dG and a perfectly good CMS. This tool turns the epitope question into COLUMNS,
so it can be filtered:

    sapia run proteinmpnn ... -f 'epitope_status == "OK" and epitope_hotspot_recall >= 0.5'
    # and its inverse, to see what ignored the epitope entirely:
    #   -f 'epitope_status == "OK" and epitope_hotspot_recall == 0.0'
    # recall is binary per residue; when nearly every design grazes a hotspot it
    # discriminates nothing, and the WEIGHT is the question instead:
    #   -f 'epitope_his_status == "OK" and epitope_his_hotspot_contact_frac < 0.05'

PREMISE AND SCOPE. Two sets of chains in ONE structure file: ``--design-chains``
(the binder) and ``--target-chains`` (the target), plus a list of target residues
the binder was MEANT to touch (``--hotspots``). It measures heavy-atom CONTACT
between the two sides and nothing else:

  * NOT buried surface area, NOT shape complementarity -- use ``cms``.
  * NOT interface energy, NOT packing -- use ``pyrosetta`` (if_dG, if_dSASA).
  * NOT whether the structure it is scoring is TRUSTWORTHY. It scores the
    coordinates it is given. On a predicted complex it must be read AFTER the gate
    that says the target landed (usalign of the predicted target chains against the
    template) -- a prediction that placed the target wrongly will still produce a
    tidy hotspot_recall, of a fiction.
  * It makes no assembly, oligomer or membrane assumptions -- that is ``ringfit``,
    whose numbers (bridge_ratio, n_clash, lipid_clash) are undefined here. This
    tool is equally happy on a single-chain target, which ringfit is not.

``action: update`` -- where a binder landed is a property of a design that already
exists, so it annotates the table in place and mints no child. Run it twice with
different ``-l/--dir-label`` to score the designed backbone and its prediction onto
one table.

``default_input_column`` is the ``"not applicable"`` sentinel (as in cms, chainsel,
ssprofile): there is no honest default -- ``rfdiffusion3_path`` (designed complex),
``boltz_path`` and ``bindcraft2_path`` (predicted complexes) are all normal inputs.
The builder raises unless ``-i/--input-column`` is given, so it is effectively
required.

THE STRUCTURE COLUMN IS RESOLVED UP THE LINEAGE. The commonest invocation runs
epitope on a CHILD table (the sequence-design generation) with
``-i rfdiffusion3_path``, which lives in the PARENT. ``core/base_run.py`` hands an
update tool a plain ``read_frame(table)`` -- **not** ``join_lineage()`` -- so that
column is simply not in the frame; and ``filter_ready`` is defensive, leaving the
frame unchanged when the input column is missing rather than emptying it. So the
rows arrive "ready" with nothing to read. The builder therefore resolves each path
with ``ctx.lookup`` (row first, then up ``parent_name``/``parent_table``), exactly
as ``usalign`` resolves ``--col-b``. A design whose structure resolves NOWHERE is
**submitted anyway with an empty path** and lands in the table as
``error: could not resolve ...`` -- never dropped from the manifest, because a run
that silently submits fewer designs than the table holds is this workspace's most
expensive quiet failure.

``--sequence-column`` (optional, off by default) takes the design chain's residue
IDENTITIES from a table column instead of from the coordinates, resolved the same
way up the lineage. It exists because the sequence designer writes into a CHILD
table while the backbone that defines the interface GEOMETRY lives in the PARENT,
and that backbone's own residue names are generator artifacts rather than the
designed sequence. With the flag omitted, behaviour is exactly as before.

THE NUMBERING CONTRACT -- the reason this tool is worth its columns. A hotspot
residue number that does not exist in the target chain is an ERROR for that design,
never a recall of 0.0. Generators and predictors renumber chains from 1 (rfd3 does,
routinely), so hotspots copied off the reference structure can name residues that
are not there, or -- worse -- residues that ARE there but are different residues. A
mis-numbered hotspot silently scoring 0.0 is indistinguishable from a genuinely bad
binder, and would make a campaign discard good designs while believing its data.
Two defences, both mandatory: the error above, and ``epitope_hotspot_resnames`` --
the residue NAME found at each listed position, in the order listed, in the table
where it can be eyeballed against the reference (``A96=LYS,A99=GLU,...``).

Chain lists use the prosapia chain mini-language (``,`` separates, ``:`` is an
inclusive letter range): ``B``, ``A,B``, ``A:D``. Hotspots use the workspace's
chain-prefixed residue syntax, the same one bindcraft2 takes:
``A96,A99,A101,A155`` with ranges ``A96-99``, and ``{expr}`` islands resolved per
design against the table (``A{epitope_start}-{epitope_end}``).
