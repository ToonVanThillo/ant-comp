Submit BindCraft2 binder-design campaigns, one array task per campaign.

BindCraft2 is campaign-driven, not design-driven: one ``bindcraft design
<settings.json>`` process takes a target (or SEVERAL targets), hallucinates binder
backbones with AF2, redesigns their sequences with ProteinMPNN, refolds and filters
the candidates, and keeps going until ``number_of_final_designs`` have been accepted
or ``max_trajectories`` attempts are spent. So the unit of work here is **one
campaign per task**, not one task per design -- the designs only exist once the
campaign has run, which is why this is a ``create`` tool and why the row count is
known only at collect time.

This tool writes each campaign's settings JSON itself (from the flags below, merged
with ``--extra-settings``) and points ``project_folder`` at
``<out_dir>/campaigns/<name>/``. Everything BindCraft2 exposes that has no dedicated
flag is reachable through ``--extra-settings`` (a file, merged into every campaign)
or ``--set KEY=VALUE`` (verbatim, per run). ``bindcraft design --list-settings``
names all of them.

Targets, hotspots, coldspots and binder lengths are authored in BindCraft2's own
syntax, with ``{expr}`` placeholders resolved per-design against the table lineage
(integers, bare column names, and + - * // arithmetic; see resolve_expr):

    --hotspots 'A54,A56,A66-70'                   # literal, BC2 syntax untouched
    --hotspots 'A{epitope_start}-{epitope_end}'   # resolved per row

MULTI-TARGET AND DETARGETING
----------------------------
A campaign may carry several targets: orthologs to be bound cross-reactively, and
off-targets to be avoided. Each is one ``--target`` (root) or ``--extra-target``
(added beside the table's own target), written as ``;``-separated ``key=value``
fields in BindCraft2's own ``targets[]`` vocabulary -- ``;`` rather than ``,``
because hotspot lists already use commas:

    --target 'name=hPDL1;path=t/hPDL1.pdb;chains=A;hotspots=A54,A56;weight=1'
    --target 'name=hPD1;path=t/hPD1.pdb;objective=detarget;weight=-0.5'

A negative ``weight`` also selects detargeting, exactly as upstream does. Shipped
targets are named instead of described, and ``--shipped-target`` is repeatable.

Usage:
    # child run: one campaign per target structure already in a table
    sapia run bindcraft2 outputs/RUN --table table0 -i pdb_path \\
        --hotspots 'A54,A56,A66,A115' --binder-lengths 60-100 --num-designs 10

    # root run: one campaign against a target not in any table yet
    sapia run bindcraft2 outputs/RUN \\
        --target-pdb targets/PDL1.pdb --chains A \\
        --hotspots 'A54,A56' --modality VHH --property humanize

    # cross-reactive against two orthologs, detargeting a third protein
    sapia run bindcraft2 outputs/RUN \\
        --target 'name=hPDL1;path=t/hPDL1.pdb;chains=A;hotspots=A54,A56' \\
        --target 'name=mPDL1;path=t/mPDL1.pdb;chains=A;hotspots=A36,A38' \\
        --target 'name=hPD1;path=t/hPD1.pdb;objective=detarget;weight=-0.5' \\
        --num-designs 10

    # the table's target, plus an off-target to avoid
    sapia run bindcraft2 outputs/RUN -t table0 -i pdb_path \\
        --extra-target 'name=hPD1;path=t/hPD1.pdb;weight=-0.5'

    # backbones only: stop before BindCraft2's own ProteinMPNN, to redesign the
    # sequences with this workspace's tools instead
    sapia run bindcraft2 outputs/RUN --target-pdb targets/PDL1.pdb \\
        --trajectory-only --max-trajectories 40 --hotspots 'A54,A56'

    # warm the 5.3 GB AlphaFold parameter Volume, running no campaign
